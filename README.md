# Welcome to Node JS!
Thanks for stopping by! This repository is host to the code for the Due or Die app, a due date tracking application that we're building together as a way to introduce new developers to Node.js by following our article series on the [Schulich Ignite blog](https://schulichignite.com/blog/). Each branch of this repository will contain the code for each corresponding lesson and the lessons before it so that if you're following along at home you can watch the project code grow with each new concept we learn, and compare your code against mine if you run into any errors.

## Due Or Die
Due or Die is a due date tracking application that you can use in your courses, or at least it will be once it's done. The requirements that we've set out for this application as per the first article in the series are:

- Allow users to create an account
- Allow users to submit courses they are enrolled in
- Allow users to create assignments/exams for their courses with their due dates
- Save the users account to a database with information about their submitted courses and due dates
- Display a dashboard for each user which summarizes their account information and displays upcoming due dates
- Add an option for a user to be reminded that a due date is coming up via email

In creating an app with these criteria we should be able to provide you with a good idea of how to set up and start a Node based project, what some of the common modules you'll need to use are, and introduce you to a stack using Node that you can use for your own projects.

## So far we've covered...
Nothing! This is the code that belongs with the first article in the series which can be found [here](add link after post). This section will be updated with the things we've covered so far as future posts come out and code gets added to our repository.

## In this article...
In this article we covered some Node basics to set up our series. Follow along with the article to learn about what Node is and why it's a good choice for developers, as well as how to install Node and NPM and use it to run your first JavaScript file.

The JavaScript file that I ran in the article is helloThere.js which can be found in the current branch, but I also encourage you to write your own JS files and run them!
